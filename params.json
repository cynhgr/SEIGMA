The project fulfills Section 71 of the 2011 Expanded Gaming Act, which requires the MGC to establish “an annual research agenda” to assist in understanding the social and economic effects of the introduction of casino gambling in MA, and in making annual scientifically-based recommendations to the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe study will focus particularly on problem gambling, but will also examine a wide array of social and economic effects of expanded gambling in Massachusetts. In addition to SPHHS, other key members of the research team include the [UMass Donahue Institute](http://www.donahue.umassp.edu/), which will lead the economic and fiscal impact research, and NORC at the University of Chicago, which will lead primary data collection efforts for the SEIGMA study.

She received her Bachelor’s at California State University, Fullerton. Emily is currently the Shiny Coordinator for SEIGMA. In addition, she is presently developing modular lessons for teaching statistics using R for undergraduate and graduate students on an open source learning repository, StatTeachR.org. Previous research consists of developing appropriate techniques for analyzing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and disease outcomes, work on genetic linkage using microarray data, statistical testing on honey bee pathogens, investigation of high risk behaviors based on data from the Iowa Youth Survey while studying at the University of Iowa’s Summer Institute in Biostatistics (ISIB), and modeling HIV using an intracellular delay-differential equation model while studying abroad in Thailand. Emily is also Co-Chair of Graduate Students Interested in Data (GRiD), the Vice-President of the Public Health Club and an organizer for the Western Mass Data Science, Stats, and R Meetup. She is actively interested in big data, data visualization techniques, clinical trials and infectious disease and cancer studies. After obtaining her MS, she will continue to a PhD program in Biostatistics with the ultimate goal of entering the professional world of Biostatistical Research.\r\n\r\nArvind Ramakrishnan is a second-year graduate biostatistics student in the Department of Public Health at UMass Amherst.  He obtained his bachelor’s degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2012 in Biomedical Engineering.  Prior to joining the Public Health department at UMass, Arvind worked at Brigham and Women’s Hospital as a part of the Physician Organization’s Analytics Department. This past summer Arvind worked as a data management intern for RaNA Therapeutics; a young pharmaceutical research start-up company in Cambridge. He also worked a second internship, as a part-time intern for the Massachusetts Council on Compulsive Gambling (MCCG), where he was immersed in current gambling research and worked to categorize and document new research treatments for gambling addictions. His project was to initialize and develop a comprehensive research database as a reference tool for the employees at MCCG. Currently he is a member of the Shiny team, which is developing interactive web-based maps using R to illustrate the socioeconomic data from SEIGMA in an engaging fashion.\r\n\r\nJenna Kiridly is a first year Master’s student in the University of Massachusetts Community Health Education program.  She graduated from Boston University with a B.A. in Biology concentrating in Molecular Biology and Genetics.  She has worked in various labs focusing on autoimmune disease, macular degeneration, and gene risk.   She currently works with the UMass Amherst School of Public Health and Health Sciences for the Social and Economic Impacts of Gambling in Massachusetts study creating and evaluating an interactive platform for collected data using the shiny app in R studio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Where can I get more information?\r\nVisit the official SEIGMA webpage [here](http://www.umass.edu/seigma/). \r\n\r\nFor all SHINY inquiries, contact:\r\nJenna Kiridly\r\nEmail: seigmateam@gmail.com\r\n\r\nFor all general SEIGMA inquiries, contact:\r\nAmanda Houpt\r\nEmail: ahoupt@schoolph.umass.edu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
